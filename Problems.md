# Branching & Looping Statements Problems

This file lists the programming exercises focused on branching and looping statements in Java. The solutions to these problems are implemented in the Java files in this repository (`QuestionOne.java` to `QuestionSixA.java`).

## Problem Statement

**Branching & Looping Statements**

Write a programming solution with code for the below questions:

1) Write a program to print the numbers from 10 to 50 using a for loop/while loop.  
   Output=Negative *(Note: This output label seems to be a typo; the program should simply print the numbers from 10 to 50.)*

2) Write a program that finds if a given number is negative or positive.  
   Input=123  
   Output=Positive  
   Input=-100  
   Output=Negative

3) Write down the program to reverse the given number using loops.  
   Input=876  
   Output=678

4) Write a Java program to find the smallest number among three numbers.

5) Write a Java program that takes the purchase amount as input and calculates the final payable amount after applying the discount:  
   - If the purchase amount is less than 500, no discount is applied.  
   - If the purchase amount is between 500 and 1000, a 10% discount is applied.  
   - If the purchase amount is greater than 1000, a 20% discount is applied.

6) Write a Java program to print the below pattern (i, j, k => 5):  
   ```
   5 5 5 5 5
   5 4 4 4 4
   5 4 3 3 3
   5 4 3 2 2
   5 4 3 2 1
   ```
